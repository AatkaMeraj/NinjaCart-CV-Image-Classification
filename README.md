# NinjaCart-CV-Vegetable-Image-Classification

🚀 Project Overview

Ninjacart, India's largest fresh produce supply chain company, aims to automate vegetable recognition using image classification. The objective of this project is to develop a robust model that can:

✅ Classify vegetables from images with high accuracy.
✅ Detect noise and correctly label images that do not contain any identifiable vegetable.

🎯 Objective

Build an image classification model to identify different types of vegetables.

🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

Programming: Python 🐍
Deep Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow / PyTorch
Image Processing: OpenCV
Models: CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks), Transfer Learning(VGG16)
Dataset Handling: Pandas, NumPy, TensorFlow Datasets

📂 Dataset

Images: Various types of vegetables
Labels: Correct vegetable type 
Preprocessing: Resizing, normalization, data augmentation

🔍 Approach

1️⃣ Data Preprocessing: Resize, normalize, and augment images.
2️⃣ Model Selection: Implement CNN architecture and Transfer Learning 
3️⃣ Training & Evaluation: Train models and evaluate performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
4️⃣ Noise Detection: Implement a rejection mechanism for incorrect/noisy images.
5️⃣ Deployment: Develop a simple user interface for image uploads and classification.

📈 Expected Outcomes

🔹 High-accuracy vegetable classification model.
🔹 Reliable detection of non-vegetable images (noise).
🔹 Optimized automation for Ninjacart’s supply chain.
